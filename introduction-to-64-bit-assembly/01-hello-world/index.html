<div class="markdown-body"><h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>In keeping with tradition, the first program we write should do nothing except
print out "Hello, world!" and then exit. In most languages, this is a one- or
two-line snippet, but in assembly it takes a little more than that. Don't worry
though, it's conceptually the same as in any other language. All we need to do
is tell the operating system what to print.</p>

<h1>The program</h1>

<p>Start by opening up your favorite text editor and typing the following program:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .data</span>

<span class="pl-en">    message db </span><span class="pl-s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .text</span>

<span class="pl-c1">global</span> <span class="pl-en">_start</span>
<span class="pl-en">_start:</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rsi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> message</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">14</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>

<p>This probably looks surprisingly complicated for a program which only prints a
line of text to the console. However, while it is undeniably verbose, it's not
actually complex: only a single high-level action is performed by this code. It
just happens to be broken up into a lot of lines.</p>

<p>At its highest level, this program is divided into two sections: <em>data</em> and
<em>text</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>data</strong> section contains data which the program will use. When the
program runs, the contents of this section will be loaded into memory and
made available for use by the code. In this case, the data section contains
a string of text called <em>message</em>, which we'll be printing out to the
console.</li>
<li>The <strong>text</strong> section is where the code goes. This is a list of instructions
that tells the computer what to do when the program runs. In this case, it
will be telling the operating system to print the string <em>message</em> to the
console.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: in assembly, you can't have literal strings (like "Hello, world!") mixed
directly into your code. Data and the code that acts on that data must be
declared in separate sections.</em></p>

<p>We'll break the program down and examine each line one at a time.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .data</span></pre></div>

<p>This begins the data section, where static data of any kind can be provided to
your program. When the program runs, the operating system will load this data
into memory and it will be made available to your code to read or manipulate.</p>

<p>The data here can be anything: numbers, arrays, strings, or anything else.
Data is really just a series of 0s and 1s, and it's up to the code to interpret
that data. The meaning or context of the data comes from how your code deals
with it.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    message db </span><span class="pl-s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span></pre></div>

<p>This line declares a string called <em>message</em>, with a value of "Hello, world!".
Breaking this line down further, you can see it's comprised of several parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>message</strong> - The name you will use later (in the code section) to refer to
            the data being declared. Wherever <em>message</em> appears in the
            code, the computer will know you mean this "Hello, world!"
            string. This name is up to you as the programmer. It should be
            descriptive, and what it refers to should be clear.</li>
<li>
<strong>db</strong> - This is the data type. In this case, <code>db</code> means that the data being
       declared is a series of bytes. Bytes are 8-bit integers, each with a
       value from 0-255. We're using bytes because each character in an
       ASCII string can be represented by one byte. There are other options
       for this field, like <code>dw</code>, <code>dd</code>, and <code>dq</code>, which refer to larger
       integers.</li>
<li>
<strong>"Hello, world!"</strong> - This is the data that <em>message</em> will refer to, and is
                    what we will be printing out to the console later. Each
                    letter, comma, space, or exclamation point is one byte.</li>
<li>
<strong>, 10</strong> - This is actually a continuation of the data "Hello, world!". This
         is the ASCII code for a newline character, which will be added to
         the end of the string. It will make sure that after the string is
         printed, the console advances to the next line, rather than just
         writing the next prompt out on the same line as our text. If
         you're used to other languages, this is comparable to the "\n" in
         "Hello, world!\n".</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .text</span></pre></div>

<p>This marks the end of the <em>data</em> section and the beginning of the <em>text</em>
section, which is where the code goes. The data section simply declares
static data for later use, but code is a series of instructions which control
the computer and modify its state.</p>

<p>For this simple program, we're only going to do one thing: print a line of text
to the console. Of course, as a lowly program running on a multi-user system
like modern Linux, we can't interact directly with the video hardware to change
what appears on screen (and we wouldn't want to either, since that would
require in-depth technical knowledge of every video card we want to support,
and make it impossible for our programs to run alongside other programs). So
instead, we tell the operating system what we want to print to the console, and
it does all the hard work for us. The way this is done is by performing a
<em>system call</em>. We will set a number of <em>registers</em> which will explain to Linux
the work we want it to do for us, and then tell Linux when we're ready for it
to go. This will require a handful of lines of code, but conceptually they make
up a single operation.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">global</span> <span class="pl-en">_start</span>
<span class="pl-en">_start:</span></pre></div>

<p>These two lines do different things, but they are closely connected. Basically,
this defines the entry-point of the program. When the program is run, the line
immediately following <code>_start:</code> will be executed first. This is how the
computer knows which instruction to start with when the program is run.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span></pre></div>

<p>This is the first real line of code: the first instruction which the processor
will actually execute. Let's break it down into pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>mov</strong> is the instruction type, or <em>opcode</em>. It's a command, and it tells
the processor what kind of action to carry out. In this case, <code>mov</code> stands
for "move". It's used to move data and values around between registers and
memory. We'll get into these in more detail later, but for now you can think
of <code>mov</code> as a way to shuffle information around so it can be worked on or
stored for later.</li>
<li>
<strong>rax</strong> refers to a register. This is a temporary storage location, which
values can be written to, read from, or operated on. There are lots of
registers: rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rbp, rsp, rdi, rsi, etc. Many of them have
special purposes or are reserved for certain things, but rax is a
general purpose register. This means it can be used by a programmer for
whatever they need. If you're coming from a higher level language, you can
think of registers as built-in global variables. In fact, they're
significantly faster than typical variables, because they're not located in
system memory: they're located inside the processor itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>1</strong> is an immediate value, which means the value "1" is encoded directly
into the instruction. We're not moving information from a register or from
a memory address, it's just the literal value "1".</li>
</ul>

<p>All together, this instruction tells the processor to put the value 1 into
the register <code>rax</code>. It can be read as "move 1 into rax" or "load rax with 1" or
whatever you prefer. If you're used to higher level programming languages, you
can think of it as <code>rax = 1</code>.</p>

<p>After this instruction executes, <code>rax</code> will be set to the value 1. This is
because we're preparing to make a call to the operating system. 1 stands for
<em>sys_write</em>, which tells the operating system to write some data to a file or
stream. <code>rax</code> is the register Linux checks to figure out what a program wants
it to do.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span></pre></div>

<p>This is very similar to the above, but in this case we're loading the value 1
into the register <code>rdi</code>. In this context, 1 stands for STDOUT, which means to
write to the console. This could also be 2 to write to STDERR, which is
normally where errors are written.</p>

<p>After this instruction executes, both <code>rax</code> and <code>rdi</code> will be set to the value
1.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rsi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> message</span></pre></div>

<p>We've told Linux we want to write some data (<code>rax</code> = 1) and we've told it where
to write that data (<code>rdi</code> = 1). Now we need to tell Linux <em>what</em> to write. Here
we set <code>rsi</code> to the beginning of our "Hello, world!" string. When Linux checks
this register to see what data to write to STDOUT, it will find the location
in memory where the <em>message</em> string begins.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">14</span></pre></div>

<p>Now we tell Linux how many bytes of <em>message</em> to write. This may seem weird.
The reason for this is when we set <code>rsi</code> to <em>message</em>, we didn't really set
<code>rsi</code> to the entire string "Hello, world!". Registers like <code>rsi</code> on a 64-bit
processor only have 64 bits each, which is 8 bytes. The string "Hello, world!"
is ASCII, where each character takes up one byte. This means our string takes
up a total of 14 bytes including the newline at the end. So it's impossible to
store the entire string in a single register all at once. What we do instead is
store the location in memory where the string begins.</p>

<p>When Linux goes to examine <code>rsi</code>, it won't see "Hello, world!", it will see an
address that points to a location in memory where the letter "H" is. By
continually reading the next address, it will be able to see all of "Hello,
world!" one character at a time. However, it would have no way of knowing when
to stop. After the string, it would keep reading whatever happened to be in
memory after the string. It might be uninitialized garbage data, it might be
other values or strings in the program, or it might even be memory this program
isn't allowed to access. So we have to tell Linux when to stop writing data.
We do that by setting the value of <code>rdx</code> to the number of bytes/characters
to print. In this case that number is 14, in order to include the entire string
"Hello, world!" and the trailing newline character (the 10).</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>

<p>Okay, we're all set to call Linux! This line lets the operating system know we
have some work for it to do and that the details of that work have been loaded
into the proper registers. When this line is executed, control will be passed
from our program to the operating system. Linux will check the values we loaded
into the registers <code>rax</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, and <code>rdx</code>, and it will use those values
to determine what to do.</p>

<p>Linux will do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check <code>rax</code> and find the value 1, which stands for sys_write. This means
we want to write some data.</li>
<li>Check <code>rdi</code> to see <em>where</em> to write the data and find 1, which stands
for STDOUT (the console).</li>
<li>Check <code>rsi</code> to see <em>what</em> data to write, and find the address of our string.</li>
<li>Check <code>rdx</code> to see how much data to write, and find the length of our
string.</li>
<li>Finally, with these 4 questions answered, Linux will write 14 characters
starting from the "H" in "Hello, world!" out to the console, and then return
control to our program.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Running the program</h1>

<p>Type the above program into your preferred text editor, and save the file as
"hello.asm". There are two necessary steps before we can actually run it.</p>

<p>First, we will use an assembler to convert the program into machine code. We'll
be using a program called <em>nasm</em> to do this. On the terminal, type the
following command and hit enter. Make sure you're in the same directory as the
file "hello.asm" which you just created.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>nasm -f elf64 hello.asm</pre></div>

<p>This runs the nasm program, telling it to assemble the file "hello.asm". The
contents of "hello.asm" will be converted from assembly language into machine
code and the output will be written to a new file called "hello.o". This is
called an object file.</p>

<p>The <code>-f elf64</code> part tells nasm that this is a 64-bit program. Without this
option, nasm will assume that "hello.asm" is a 32-bit program and fail, since
it's not 32-bit code.</p>

<p>If nasm reports any errors, check that you typed the program exactly as it
appears above and try again. If it's successful, there won't be any output.</p>

<p>The file "hello.o" should now be present alongside "hello.asm". This is the
machine code version of your program. The code you wrote has been converted
into a format the computer is capable of executing.</p>

<p>However, it's still not quite ready to run. Right now, it's just a blob of
machine code and data. The operating system wouldn't know what to do with it.
In order for the operating system to understand it, we have to use a linker to
convert it into an executable file format. In this case, we'll be using the
GNU linker (called <em>ld</em> to turn our object file into an executable
file ready for Linux to run:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>ld hello.o</pre></div>

<p>This runs the GNU program <em>ld</em> and tells it to take our object file "hello.o"
and make it into an executable file. By default it will name this new
executable file "a.out".</p>

<p>Now for the moment of truth: run the program!</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./a.out</pre></div>

<p>If everything went well, you should see the following output:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>Hello, world<span class="pl-k">!</span>
Segmentation fault (core dumped)</pre></div>

<p>Uh, that's not quite what we expected.</p>

<h1>Segmentation fault!</h1>

<p>So our program sort of worked. It wrote the string out to the console as
expected, but we also got a very nasty error: the dreaded segfault.</p>

<p>A segmentation fault basically means that the operating system didn't like
something that a program did (or tried to do). It often happens when a program
tries to access memory that it doesn't own or uses an instruction in an invalid
way. Segmentation faults can be very frustrating because they give so little
information about what exactly happened or even where in the program the error
occurred.</p>

<p>In this case, it's not actually that complicated: we just forgot to exit the
program. Linux expects that when a program is finished running, it will tell it
so. We didn't do that: we printed a string to the console, and then did nothing
else. Linux had no way of knowing if we were really finished, or if it should
keep trying to run instructions. To fix this problem, we need to make another
system call like the console print call we made above.</p>

<p>Add the following code to the end of your program:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">60</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>

<p>This should look pretty familiar, but we'll step through it like above to point
out the differences:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">60</span></pre></div>

<p>We're making another system call to Linux, but this time with a different
command. Instead of a 1, which means <em>sys_write</em>, we're passing a 60, which
means <em>sys_exit</em>. This tells the operating system that the program is finished
running and it's safe to shut it down and remove it from memory.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span></pre></div>

<p>Next we set <code>rdi</code> to 0. This is the exit status code.  Whenever a program
finishes, it returns a status code, which other programs can use to determine
whether a program finished successfully. In this case nothing went wrong, so we
return a 0, which indicates success.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we make the system call. Linux checks <code>rax</code> to determine what to do.
It finds 60, which means we want to end the program, so that's what it does.</p>

<p>Re-assemble, re-link, and re-run the program after saving the new changes:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>nasm -f elf64 hello.asm
ld hello.o
./a.out</pre></div>

<p>You should now only see the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>Hello, world<span class="pl-k">!</span></pre></div>

<p>We exited the program the way Linux expects, so the segmentation fault is gone!
You can also see the error code by running the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">echo</span> <span class="pl-smi">$?</span></pre></div>

<p>This line will print out the status code of the last program run. Since we
set <code>rdi</code> to 0 before returning, 0 will be returned in this case. Try
changing the value of <code>rdi</code> to something else and seeing it change the result
of <code>echo $?</code>.</p>

<p><em>Note: if you run <code>echo $?</code> multiple times it will always show 0 after the
first run. This is because echo is itself a program which returns 0 on
success. So if you run it twice, then on the second run, it will be reporting
the exit code of the previous time it was run, rather than the status code of
the program run before that.</em></p>

<h1>Improving the code</h1>

<p>There are some problems with this program. Primarily, we're using a lot
of <em>magic numbers</em>: numbers like 1, 0, and 60, which have special meanings
but only within certain contexts. This hurts the readability of the program.
Any time you can, you should try to avoid using these magic numbers because
they make the program harder to read without providing any benefits.</p>

<p>An easy way to fix this problem is to use macros. Macros in <em>nasm</em> allow you
to define a string of descriptive text which, when the file is assembled, will
be replaced with something else. A macro looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_write </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span></pre></div>

<p>This macro definition tells <em>nasm</em> to replace all occurrences of the word
"sys_write" with the value "1" during assembly. We can use this to improve the
readability of the program. Change the program to match the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_write </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>
<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">stdout </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>

<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_exit </span><span class="pl-c1">60</span>
<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">success </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>

<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">nl </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .data</span>

<span class="pl-en">    message db </span><span class="pl-s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> nl</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .text</span>

<span class="pl-c1">global</span> <span class="pl-en">_start</span>
<span class="pl-en">_start:</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_write</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> stdout</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rsi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> message</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">14</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span>

<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_exit</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> success</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>

<p>It's now much easier to tell at a glance which system calls are being made
and what they're doing. Rather than a bunch of integers scattered throughout
the code, there are descriptive bits of text.</p>

<p>But there's still one magic number, and it's an even worse offender than the
others! The 14, which corresponds to the number of characters in the
<em>message</em> string is not only a magic number, it's also dependent on another
value in the program. If we were to change the value of <em>message</em> to some other
text, we would also have to remember to go and update the <code>mov rdx, 14</code> line to
match the new length of <em>message</em>. In a simple program like this, that wouldn't
be a big deal. But in a more complicated program with hundreds or thousands of
instructions, where a single string might be re-used several times throughout
the code, it could require hunting down lots of system calls and updating the
character count over and over. It would be easy to miss some of the places
where the change needed to happen, and depending on how well we tested the
program, we may not even realize we'd missed a spot until much later when a
user of the program reported a bug.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, we can use a feature of nasm which allows us to define
a symbol whose value is automatically set to the length of a string:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    message_len equ $</span><span class="pl-s1">-</span><span class="pl-en">message</span></pre></div>

<p>This sets the symbol <em>message_len</em> to be equal to the number of bytes in the
symbol <em>message</em>. So whenever the assembler encounters "message_len" in the

<p>No more magic numbers! You can change the "Hello, world!" text to be anything
you want and you don't have to worry about changing the system call that prints
it.  The literal values like 0, 1, and 60 still appear in the code, but they're
defined - at a glance you can see what they mean. And the code itself under
<code>_start:</code> is much clearer and what it does is more obvious.</p>

<h1>Extra credit</h1>

<ol>
<li>Make the program print the "Hello, world!" message multiple times.</li>
<li>Change the program to make it print several different messages instead of
just "Hello, world!".</li>
