<div class="markdown-body"><h1>Looping</h1>
<p>We're going to write a program to calculate exponents. Before we can do that,
we need to discuss looping.</p>
<p>A loop is a series of instructions which can be executed repeatedly. When
execution reaches the end, it jumps back to the beginning and runs the loop
again. This continues until some criteria is reached which causes the loop to
stop. Take a look at the following minimal example:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>

<span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">add</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">2</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jmp</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>This snippet starts by setting <code>rax</code> to 0. Then, it continually adds 2 to
<code>rax</code>. Let's look at it in more detail:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span></pre></div>
<p>Before the loop begins, the register <code>rax</code> is set to 0.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span></pre></div>
<p>This is a label, marking the start of the loop. We can jump to this label any
time we want the loop to run again.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">add</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">2</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the body of the loop. This instruction is executed each time the loop
runs. It adds 2 to the value of <code>rax</code>, so every time the loop runs, <code>rax</code> will
be increased by 2. Since <code>rax</code> starts at 0, if the loop runs 10 times, <code>rax</code>
will be set to 20 by the end.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jmp</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>This instruction causes the loop to start over. Every time this instruction
is reached, the loop will start back over at the beginning. This will
cause <code>add rax, 2</code> to run over and over again.</p>
<p>There's just one problem with this loop: it never ends. This is what is known
as an infinite loop, because it continues forever. If you were to run a
program with this loop inside, that program would appear to freeze. The loop
would run continually until the program or computer was forcibly halted.</p>
<p>In order to be useful, a loop must have some termination criteria: some
condition under which the loop ceases to repeat. Take a look at the following
updated snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>

<span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">add</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">2</span>

<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">cmp</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jl</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>This is a bit different. <code>rax</code> still starts at 0, and 2 is still added to <code>rax</code>
each time the loop runs. But now, instead of the <em>unconditional jump</em> at the
end of the loop, there is now a <em>conditional jump</em>, which only repeats the loop
if certain criteria are met.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">cmp</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span></pre></div>
<p>This instruction compares the value of <code>rax</code> to 10. The possible results of
this comparison are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rax</code> could be greater than 10</li>
<li><code>rax</code> could be equal to 10</li>
<li><code>rax</code> could be less than 10</li>
</ul>
<p>When this instruction runs, the results of the comparison will be stored in the
<code>rflags</code> register. This instruction does not act on the result of the
comparison by itself, it sets things up so the next instruction can.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jl</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>This is a conditional jump. It only jumps to the given label <em>loop_start:</em>
if <code>rax</code> is less than 10. If <code>rax</code> is greater than or equal to 10, the jump
doesn't happen and the loop ends.</p>
<p>There are several variants of the conditional jump instruction. The <em>jl</em>
instruction above stands for "<em>j</em>ump if <em>l</em>ess than".</p>
<p>Altogether, this snippet's behavior can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rax</code> is set to its starting value of 0.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is less than 10, so the loop restarts.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is increased to 2.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is less than 10, so the loop restarts.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is increased to 4.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is less than 10, so the loop restarts.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is increased to 6.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is less than 10, so the loop restarts.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is increased to 8.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is less than 10, so the loop restarts.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is increased to 10.</li>
<li><code>rax</code> is <strong>not</strong> less than 10, so the loop does not restart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The loop runs 5 times, adding 2 to <code>rax</code> each time, until <code>rax</code> reaches 10.</p>
<h1>A basic loop with output</h1>
<p>This small program is going to use a loop to print a line of text to the
console over and over. Take a look at the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_write </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>
<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">stdout </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>

<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_exit </span><span class="pl-c1">60</span>

<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">newline </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .data</span>

<span class="pl-en">    output: db </span><span class="pl-s">"Greetings!"</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> newline</span>
<span class="pl-en">    output_len: equ $</span><span class="pl-s1">-</span><span class="pl-en">output</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .text</span>

<span class="pl-c1">global</span> <span class="pl-en">_start</span>
<span class="pl-en">_start:</span>

<span class="pl-c">; The number of times to print the text out</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">7</span>

<span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span>

<span class="pl-c">; Print the text to the console</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_write</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> stdout</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rsi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> output</span>

<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span>

<span class="pl-c">; Decrement the loop counter</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">dec</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span>

<span class="pl-c">; Continue the loop while rbx &gt; 0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">cmp</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jg</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span>


<span class="pl-c">; Exit the program</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_exit</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>We're using <code>rbx</code> to keep track of how many times to print the text. Each time
the loop runs, it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prints the text out</li>
<li>Subtracts 1 from the loop counter <code>rbx</code></li>
<li>Starts over if <code>rbx</code> is still greater than 0</li>
</ol>
<p>In closer detail:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .data</span>

<span class="pl-en">    output: db </span><span class="pl-s">"Greetings!"</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> newline</span>
<span class="pl-en">    output_len: equ $</span><span class="pl-s1">-</span><span class="pl-en">output</span></pre></div>
<p>We've added a data section containing two values:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>output</strong> - the string to print to the console</li>
<li><strong>output_len</strong> - the number of characters in the output string</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; The number of times to print the text out</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">7</span></pre></div>
<p>This sets the number of times the loop will run and keeps track of when to
stop repeating the loop.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the beginning of the loop.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Print the text to the console</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_write</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> stdout</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rsi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> output</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> output_len</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the body of the loop. Here we print the string <em>output</em> to the console.
This will be executed repeatedly each time the loop runs.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Decrement the loop counter</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">dec</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span></pre></div>
<p>Now the loop counter in <code>rbx</code> has to be decremented to keep track of how many
times the loop has run. Each time the loop runs, we subtract 1 from <code>rbx</code>. So
at any point during the program, <code>rbx</code> contains the number of iterations left
to run before the loop will be finished.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Continue the loop while rbx &gt; 0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">cmp</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jg</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>Here we check the loop counter against 0. If <code>rbx</code> is greater than 0, the loop
continues. If <code>rbx</code> has reached 0, the loop ends.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Exit the program</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_exit</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>At this point, the loop will have run 7 times and then stopped. The program
exits.</p>
<p>Type the program above into a file called "printspam.asm" and run it. You
should see the text "Greetings!" written out 7 times. Try changing the printed
text to something else. Also try changing the initial value of <code>rbx</code> from 7 to
something else. Whatever value <code>rbx</code> starts with is the number of times the
string will be printed.</p>
<p>However, there's actually a bug in this program: if you set <code>rbx</code> to 0, the
string will still be printed once. This is because we're using the wrong loop
style for the job. The loop in this program is called a <em>do..while</em> loop, which
works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the output string</li>
<li>Check if the loop should end yet and start over if not</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the test to decide whether the loop should end doesn't happen until
the end of the loop, after the string has already been printed. This means that
the loop will always run at least one time, since we don't check if it should
keep going until after it has already run. No matter what value you give to
<code>rbx</code>, it will always print the string at least one time.</p>
<p>This style of loop is called a "do..while" loop. The conditional check happens
at the end of the loop body, so the loop always runs at least once no matter
what the result of the conditional check is.</p>
<p>We can solve this problem by using a <em>while</em> loop. A <em>while</em> loop is another
style of loop where the conditional check happens at the beginning of the loop,
before the print operation. The loop will be reorganized to look more like
this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the loop should end yet and jump out of the loop if so</li>
<li>Print the output string</li>
<li>Go back to step 1</li>
</ol>
<p>By checking to see if the loop should end at the very beginning of the loop,
we prevent the output string from printing at all if <code>rbx</code> is 0 or a negative
number.</p>
<p>Take a look at the updated program:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_write </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>
<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">stdout </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span>

<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_exit </span><span class="pl-c1">60</span>

<span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">newline </span><span class="pl-c1">10</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .text</span>

<span class="pl-c1">global</span> <span class="pl-en">_start</span>
<span class="pl-en">_start:</span>

<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>Now the conditional check happens at the beginning of the loop. Let's go over
the changes in more detail:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; The number of times to print the text out</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span></pre></div>
<p><code>rbx</code> now starts at 0. The string should never be printed if the counter starts
at 0.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the start of the loop.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Check if the loop should end yet</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">cmp</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jle</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_stop</span></pre></div>
<p>At the very beginning of each loop iteration, we check to see if the loop
should end yet.</p>
<p>The <em>cmp</em> instruction is the same as before, but we're using a different form
of conditional jump. <em>jle</em> stands for "<strong>j</strong>ump if <strong>l</strong>ess than or <strong>e</strong>qual
to". So once <code>rbx</code> hits 0, we jump out of the loop to the <em>loop_stop:</em> label.</p>
<p>As long as <code>rbx</code> is greater than 0, we run the loop body:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Print the text to the console</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_write</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> stdout</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rsi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> output</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> output_len</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>The output string is printed to the console.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Decrement the loop counter</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">dec</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span></pre></div>
<p>The loop counter is decremented, to keep track of the number of times the loop
has run.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Run the loop again</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jmp</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>Here we jump back to the start of the loop. This is an unconditional jump,
meaning it jumps no matter what. Since we now check if the loop should continue
at the beginning of the loop, we don't need to check it here at the end.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">loop_stop:</span></pre></div>
<p>This is where we jump when the loop ends. Once <code>rbx</code> hits 0, the <em>jle</em>
instruction will jump here, breaking out of the loop.</p>
<p>Type the new program into a file (or edit the old one) and run it again. You
should see that the bug has been fixed. If <code>rbx</code> is set to 0, the string
never prints. If <code>rbx</code> is set to a positive integer (5, 7, etc), the string is
printed that number of times.</p>
<h1>Exponents</h1>
<p>Now we're going to write a program to calculate exponents. We want to be able
to take an input like 2 and a power like 3 and calculate the result. With
those example values, we should get <code>2 ^ 3 = 8</code>. <code>2 ^ 3</code> is the same as
<code>2 * 2 * 2</code>. So we can calculate this by repeatedly multiplying a value against
itself. To do this, we'll need to use a loop similar to the ones introduced
above.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following program:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c1">%define</span> <span class="pl-en">sys_exit </span><span class="pl-c1">60</span>

<span class="pl-c1">section</span><span class="pl-en"> .text</span>

<span class="pl-c1">global</span> <span class="pl-en">_start</span>
<span class="pl-en">_start:</span>

<span class="pl-c">; Starting values: calculating 2 ^ 3</span>

<span class="pl-en">loop_stop:</span>

<span class="pl-c">; End the program</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_exit</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>Let's break it down line-by-line:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">2</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rcx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">3</span></pre></div>
<p>These are the "inputs" of the program. Since they're hard-coded into the
source, they're not technically inputs, but they are the values we'll be
operating on. Since we're trying to calculate <code>2 ^ 3</code>, both values need to be
in registers so we can work with them.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is we're going to have a loop which multiplies the value
in <code>rbx</code> by itself. <code>rcx</code> will keep track of how many times this multiplication
still needs to occur.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">1</span></pre></div>
<p><code>rax</code> will store the running total. We're going to multiply the value in <code>rbx</code>
(2) against the value in <code>rax</code> the number of times specified by <code>rcx</code> (3). So
we start with <code>rax</code> set to 1, since <code>1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2 ^ 3</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">loop_start:</span></pre></div>
<p>This marks the beginning of the loop. The loop body will be run 3 times.
Execution will jump back to this point repeatedly, until <code>rcx</code> reaches 0 and
the final answer is stored in <code>rax</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Compare rcx to 0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">cmp</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rcx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">0</span></pre></div>
<p>We start by checking if the exponent <code>rcx</code> has reached 0. Since <code>rcx</code> might
start at 0 (<code>3 ^ 0 = 1</code>), we have to do this check before running the loop.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Break loop once rcx reaches 0</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jle</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_stop</span></pre></div>
<p>If <code>rcx</code> has reached 0, we end the loop by jumping out of it to the label
<em>loop_stop:</em>. This means that the loop will continue running until <code>rcx</code>
reaches 0.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Multiply rbx by rax, storing the result each time in rbx</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">imul</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span></pre></div>
<p>This is where the actual multiplication happens. Each time the loop runs, we
multiply the running total stored in <code>rax</code> by the base number in <code>rbx</code>.</p>
<p>Each time a loop runs is called an <em>iteration</em>. Take a look at the following
table, which lists each iteration and shows how <code>rax</code> increases each time as
it's multiplied by 2:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Iteration </th>
<th> rax starting value </th>
<th> rax ending value </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>     1     </td>
<td>         1          </td>
<td>        2         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>     2     </td>
<td>         2          </td>
<td>        4         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>     3     </td>
<td>         4          </td>
<td>        8         </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>The loop runs three times, each time multiplying the value in <code>rax</code> by 2.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">dec</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rcx</span></pre></div>
<p>We don't want the loop to run forever, so we need a way of keeping track of how
many times it's been run. We start the program by setting <code>rcx</code> to the value of
3 as that's how many times we want to run the loop. So each time the loop
runs, we need to reduce the value of <code>rcx</code> by 1. That's what the <em>dec</em>
instruction does: it subtracts 1 from whatever register you give it. This is
also known as decrementing.</p>
<p><em>Note: We could have also used the <strong>sub</strong> instruction like this:
<code>sub rcx, 1</code> and it would have worked the same. <code>dec rcx</code> and <code>sub rcx, 1</code>
are functionally equivalent.</em></p>
<p>See the following table which lists each iteration, including the value of
<code>rcx</code> at the end of the loop (after the <code>dec rcx</code> line) for each one:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Iteration </th>
<th> rax ending value </th>
<th> rcx ending value </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>     1     </td>
<td>        2         </td>
<td>        2         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>     2     </td>
<td>        4         </td>
<td>        1         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>     3     </td>
<td>        8         </td>
<td>        0         </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>For the first two iterations, <code>rcx</code> is greater than 0. The loop continues and
<code>rax</code> is continually multiplied by 2. On the third iteration, <code>rcx</code> reaches 0
and the loop stops. At this point, <code>rax</code> is left with its final value of 8,
which is the result of <code>2 ^ 3</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-c">; Start the loop again</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">jmp</span><span class="pl-en"> loop_start</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the end of the loop. We jump back to the beginning to keep the loop
running.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">loop_stop:</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the label we jump to in order to end/break the loop. Once <code>rcx</code> hits
0, the conditional jump instruction <em>jle</em> will jump here, breaking out of the
loop and preventing it from running again.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rdi</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rax</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> sys_exit</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">syscall</span></pre></div>
<p>When the loop ends, the result will be stored in <code>rax</code> (and it should be 8).
In order to return the value as a status exit code, it needs to be in <code>rdi</code>, so
we move it there and then end the program. 8 gets returned as the status code.</p>
<p>Type the program into a file called "exponent.asm" and run it with the "run"
script:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./run exponent</pre></div>
<p>You should see 8 returned on the console. Try changing the values of <code>rbx</code> and
<code>rcx</code> to calculate different exponents.</p>
<p>For example, try <code>7 ^ 3</code>. Modify the lines at the beginning that set the
inputs like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-assembly"><pre><span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rbx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">7</span>
<span class="pl-en">    </span><span class="pl-k">mov</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-v">rcx</span><span class="pl-s1">,</span><span class="pl-en"> </span><span class="pl-c1">3</span></pre></div>
<p>This should give us <code>7 * 7 * 7 = 343</code>, right? Wrong! System status codes use
only one byte of memory, which means they can only store a number up to 255.
When we try to return 343 in a value that can only be a maximum of 255, the
value overflows since it can't go any higher. Instead of returning 343, it
returns 87, which is <code>343 - 256</code>. This limitation makes status codes a bad way
to get this kind of output from a program. Eventually, we'll work through
converting numbers of (virtually) any size into ASCII strings and printing
those out, but we're not quite there yet.</p></div>
